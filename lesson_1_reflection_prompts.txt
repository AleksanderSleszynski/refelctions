How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

I can only see lines that's something change so i don't need to scan whole code to find bug. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If something went bad. I can return to older version where all things was allright.
 
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can choose exactly point where I want to return if something went wrong. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Yeah it treat this files abosolutly separatly. When we have big project we have tons of files in it.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Via terminal.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If you use VC you can go back to version where everythings was alrigth and then you can compare it to newr version, and check wath have been changed and fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	How to master it :D.
