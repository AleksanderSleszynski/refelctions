When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This is great when you work on more than one PC. When you afraid of loosing all you data from on of your local PC.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Probably you don't want to pull every commit you've made.
